## Usage

Hereâ€™s an overview of the key functionalities your bot provides:

- **Welcome/Goodbye Messages**: The bot will automatically send a welcome message when a new user joins and a goodbye message when they leave the server.
  
- **YouTube Notifications**: The bot will monitor a YouTube channel and post a notification to a designated channel when new videos are uploaded.

- **Banned Words Enforcement**: The bot tracks a list of banned words, and if any user sends a message containing them, they will be temporarily timed out.

- **Reward System**: Each user has a karma score, and based on their behavior, they can gain or lose points. Negative karma may result in punishments like mutes or bans, while positive behavior is rewarded.

- **Server Statistics**: The bot can display stats about server usage, such as the number of active users, total members, and message counts.

- **Moderation Tools**: Allows moderators to manage users with commands such as `kick`, `ban`, and `mute`.
